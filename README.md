# Battleships

## üë®‚ÄçüíªAbout this Project

This is the final project of the Javascript module for The Odin Project, it is not made for mobile screens (yet)

## Instructions

- Enter your name and hit start (If no name, player 1 will default to 'You')
- The Game will prompt you to place your ships
- Once all are placed, you can hit start & a short beginning sound will play. (To mute, you can mute your browser, I will add sound controls later)
- Continue taking shots until there is a winner
- Hit restart to replay
- The Ai's shots at this point are random (I will update later)

## Additional Functionality / Or Updates to be made

-
- Update the animations that are triggered by shots to only trigger on inital hit/miss
- Add the ability to toggle ships orientation prior to placement
- Add styling that shows expected ship placement while dragging a ship
- Update the random placement for AI, to vary positions in each game
- Update AI with smarter shot logic (Attack adjacent cells to a previously hit cell)
